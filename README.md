MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to ***mix*** the [flavours](http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/program_model.html) of symbolic
programming and imperative programming together to ***maximize*** the efficiency and your productivity.
In its core, a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly.
A graph optimization layer is build on top, which makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient.
The library is portable and lightweight, and is ready scales to multiple GPUs, and multiple machines.

MXNet is also more than a deep learning project. It is also a collection of
[blue prints and guidelines](http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#open-source-design-notes) for building
deep learning system, and interesting insights of DL systems for hackers.

History
-------
MXNet is initiated and designed in collaboration by authors from [cxxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/cxxnet), [minerva](https://github.com/dmlc/minerva) and [purine2](https://github.com/purine/purine2). The project reflects what we have learnt from the past projects. It combines important flavour of the existing projects, being efficient, flexible and memory efficient.
