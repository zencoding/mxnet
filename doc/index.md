MXNet Documentation
===================
[MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to mix the flavours of deep learning programs together to maximize efficiency and your productivity.

Open Source Design Notes
------------------------
This design document contains notes that are relevant to the MXNet system design and deep learning
libraries in general. We believe that open sourcing this system design note can help general audiences understand the  motivations, benefits and drawbacks of our design choices. This will help deep learning practitioners as well as builders of other deep learning systems.

This section will be updated with self-contained design notes on various aspect of deep learning systems,
in terms of abstraction, optimization and trade-offs.
